We would recommend using VSCode to run our model. 

To run our project please follow these steps:

1. Open our schelling-master folder in VSCode
2. From the toolbar Debug -> Start Debugging (or F5)
3. Enter values (we would recommend using the following but you can enter anything: 
		height = 300, width = 300, iterations = 75, races = 2, threshold = 0.2)
4. Now open the images folder where every iteration is stored 
5. The final file will be called example.gif which displays the animation of our model
